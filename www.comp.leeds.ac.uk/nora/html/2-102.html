You shall not abuse such knowledge." But the people used it in such evil schemes as the breaking up of marriages. They can never harm anyone against the will of GOD. They thus learn what hurts them, not what benefits them, and they know full well that whoever practices witchcraft will have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed is what they sell their souls for, if they only knew. </td></font>

People learned something from the two angels that could cause discord between a man and his wife. However, they could harm no one except by the permission of God. In fact, the (people) learned things that would harm them and render them no benefit. They knew very well that one who engaged in witchcraft would have no reward in the life hereafter.

But these two taught no one anything until they had said, 'We are but a trial from ALLAH, do not, therefore, reject what we say.'  So men learnt from them that by which they made a distinction between man and his wife, but they harmed no one thereby, except by the command of ALLAH; on the contrary, these people (the opponents of the Holy Prophet) are learning that which would harm them and do them no good. And they have certainly known that he who traffics therein has no share of good in the Hereafter; and surely evil is that for which they sold their souls; if only they knew. </td></font>
