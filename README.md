The Qurany Concepts Tool by Noorhan Abbas &amp; Dr.Eric Atwell 

Qurany (meaning 'my Quran' in Arabic) incorporates novel features to improve recall and precision when compared against other tools for searching for concepts in the Quran. The underlying corpus includes 8 variant English translations as well as the Arabic original. Each verse is saved in an html file along with the concepts or themes that the verse covers. These themes were imported from 'Mushaf Al Tajweed'. 'Mushaf Al Tajweed', compiled by Dr. Mohamed Habash, Director of the Islamic Studies Centre in Damascus, published by Dar Al-Maarifah in Syria and authenticated by the Al-Azhar Islamic Research Academy in Egypt
